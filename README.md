Welcome to our comprehensive machine learning tutorial covering linear regression and logistic regression in Python! In this tutorial, we'll dive deep into two fundamental techniques in supervised learning, providing you with a solid foundation to understand and implement predictive models.

Linear Regression:

Linear regression is a powerful technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. We'll walk you through the theoretical underpinnings of linear regression, discussing concepts like the least squares method and model evaluation metrics. You'll gain hands-on experience by implementing linear regression models using the popular scikit-learn library, exploring real-world datasets to predict continuous outcomes.

Logistic Regression:

Logistic regression is a widely used classification algorithm that predicts the probability of an observation belonging to a particular class. We'll explore the logistic regression algorithm, discussing its mathematical foundation and the concept of odds ratios. Through practical examples, you'll learn how to preprocess data, train logistic regression models, and interpret model outputs effectively.
